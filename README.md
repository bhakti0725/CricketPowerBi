This project aims at analysing T20 Cricket World Cup 2022 data to gather insights and select the top 11 performing players and assemble the statistically best cricket team in the world.

Tech Stack used: Python (Pandas), PowerBI

The raw data was sourced from ESPN CricInfo website (https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/match_results.html?id=14450;type=tournament) via webscraping performed with the help of Bright Data web scraper tool. Used JavaScript to code the scrapers.

Data was preprocessed using python (using the pandas library), then the raw json files were converted to csv (for easy readability).

Data cleaning, modeling, analysis and visualization was all performed in PowerBI.
